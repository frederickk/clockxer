Clockxer
======

### An analog sync clock with adjustable BPM and 2-channel passive mixer.

#### üíæ Software

Under the hood is an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) along with a [SparkFun Spectrum Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13116) ~~(for audio analysis)~~. Both of these are probably a bit overkill given the way I'm implementing things. But, I'm more comfortable with software than hardware and I had an Arduino sitting idle on my desk.

The Arduino handles the logic for reading the values from the rotary encoder ~~and analyzing the audio data for beat detection~~ (TODO üòÑ). There are two libraries that I leaned on for this.

**Third party libraries**
* [MSGEQ7](https://github.com/NicoHood/MSGEQ7) which makes it much easier to pull audio data from the [MSGEQ7](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/MSGEQ7.pdf) chips which are part of the [Spectrum Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13116).
* [Adafruit LED Backpack](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack) which handles all of the magic to display BPM value on the segment display.
* [Protothreads library](https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduinode/downloads) A library for manaing [protothreads](http://harteware.blogspot.com/2010/11/protothread-powerfull-library.html) for Arduino.

#### üéõÔ∏è Hardware

The hardware for this is pretty simple to put together. However, I can nearly guarantee that the way I've done it is not the most efficient way. For example, the [Spectrum Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13116) is a bit overkill and I could have use a singular MSGEQ7 IC. Equally, the Arduino itself is probably unnecessary for an actual electrical engineer. If you have suggestions, make a [pull request]() üôè. Within the [hardware]() folder you'll find [Fritzing]() schematic files (or consult the JPEG below).

| Input: This audio analyzed by the MSGEQ7 chips, passed through to the **sync** output, and merged with **line-in** input. | Input: is passed through and merged with **source** input. | Knob: Set BPM for **sync** output. Push to toggle whether **sync** output is active. | Output: A 5V PP signal for syncing analog devices to the given BPM. | Output: Merged audio (mono) signal of **source** and **line-in** inputs. |
| Volume: Adjust the volume of the **source** input.           | Volume: Adjust the volume of the **line-in** input.        |                                                              |                                                              | Volume: Adjust the volume of the **mix** output.             |

**Enclosure**

Of course you can use any enclosure you want, but I opted for a [diecast aluminium (black) case](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/hammond-manufacturing/1590BBSBK/1590BBSBK-ND/3869214). It's compact (119.5mm x 94mm x 42mm), but still has plenty of room for the Arduino and a 9-volt battery. I've created a [base](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/crAZhWdCvB1-clockxer-enclosure-base) that sits inside the enclosure to keep the internal components in place. For mounting the 7 Segment display I've created a [cowling](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hzLmspQi8GF-clockxer-led-cowling) to mask the terribly cut square hole.
